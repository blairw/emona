Demo of JavaFX MP3 playback.

Sample music is 'Stories From Emona I' by Maya Filipic, https://www.jamendo.com/track/196219/stories-from-emona-i, licensed under Creative Commons.

Also features a Charts Demo for my dear friends struggling to implement JavaFX charts:

Based on the Oracle docs referenced in the code :)
It even has customised colours based on the natural colours of the fruits lol. How did I do that? By adapting other public sources ... see the codebase :)
